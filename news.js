    story: 'If you are working with an eye toward retirement or even semiretirement, you are probably (hopefully) saving more than you could in the past in your retirement accounts. You may have paid off the mortgage and paid for college and other heavy expenses of raising children. That all sounds like you are on your way, except for one big problem I call the “ticking tax time bomb.”</p><br><p>I’m referring to the tax debt building up in your individual retirement account, 401(k) or other retirement savings plans. And, as I wrote in my newest book, “The New Retirement Savings Time Bomb,” it can quickly deplete the very savings you were relying on for your retirement years. But there are a few ways you can avoid this problem.</p><br><p><h4>What is the potential retirement savings tax problem?</h4>While you may be watching your savings balances grow from your continuing contributions and the rising stock market, a good chunk of that growth will go to Uncle Sam. That’s because most, if not all, of those retirement savings are tax-deferred, not tax-free.</p><br><p>The funds in most IRAs are pretax funds, meaning they have not yet been taxed. But they will be, when you reach in to spend them in retirement. That’s when you quickly realize how much of your savings you get to keep and how much will go to the government.</p><br><p>The amount going to the Internal Revenue Service will be based on what future tax rates are. And given our national debt and deficit levels, those tax rates could skyrocket, leaving you with less than you had planned on, just when you’ll need the money most.</p><br><p><h4>What you can do now</h4>So, that’s the dire warning. But you can change this potential outcome with proper planning and making changes in the way you save for retirement going forward.</p><br><p>You can begin by taking steps to pay down that tax debt at today’s low tax rates and begin building your retirement savings in tax-free vehicles like Roth IRAs or even permanent life insurance which can include cash value that builds and can be withdrawn tax-free in retirement.</p><br><p>In addition, if you are still working, you can change the way you are saving in your retirement plans. If you have a 401(k) at work, you could make contributions in a Roth 401(k) if the plan offers that. A Roth 401(k) lets your retirement savings grow 100% tax-free for the rest of your life and even pass to your beneficiaries tax-free too.</p><br><p>For 2021, you can contribute up to $26,000 (the standard $19,500 contribution limit plus a $6,500 catch-up contribution for people 50 and older). With some Roth 401(k) workplace plans, you might be able to put in even more.</p><br><p>Then, see if you can convert some of your existing 401(k) funds either to your Roth 401(k) or to a Roth IRA. Once you do this, you will owe taxes on the amount you convert. The conversion is permanent, so make sure you only convert what you can afford to pay tax on.</p><br><p>Don’t let the upfront tax bill deter you from moving your retirement funds from accounts that are forever taxed to accounts that are never taxed.</p><br><p><h4>Converting existing IRAs to Roth IRAs</h4>Similarly, you can convert your existing IRAs to Roth IRAs, lowering the tax debt on those funds as well. The point is to not be shortsighted and avoid doing this because you don’t want to pay the taxes now. That tax will have to be paid at some point, and likely at much higher future tax rates and on a larger account balance.</p><br><p>It’s best to get this process going now, maybe even with a plan to convert your 401(k) or IRA funds to Roth accounts over several years, converting small amounts each year to manage the tax bill.</p><br><p>If you have been contributing to a traditional IRA, stop making those contributions and instead start contributing to a Roth IRA. Anyone 50 or over can put in up to $7,000 a year ($6,000 plus a $1,000 catch-up contribution) and you can do so for a spouse even if that spouse is not working.</p><br><p>If one of you has enough earnings from a job or self-employment (and you don’t exceed the Roth IRA contribution income limits), each of you can contribute $7,000, totaling $14,000 in Roth IRA contributions each year. That will not only add up quickly, it will add up all in your favor because now you are accumulating retirement savings tax-free.</p><br><p>Once the funds are in a Roth IRA or other tax-free vehicles (like life insurance), those funds compound tax-free for you.</p><br><p>The secret is to pay taxes now. It’s so simple, but also so counterintuitive that most people don’t take advantage of this and end up paying heavy taxes in retirement that could have all been avoided.</p><br><p>Ed Slott is a Certified Public Accountant, an individual retirement account (IRA) distribution expert and author of “The New Retirement Savings Tax Bomb.” He is president and founder of Ed Slott and Company, providing advice and analysis about IRAs.' },

    story: 'An “environmental credit crunch” will challenge current levels of unsustainable consumption, ratcheting up the pressure on companies to solve climate-related problems and providing opportunities for investors, said Swiss investment bank UBS.</p><br><p>“Urgent action is needed to combat the growing climate crisis,” the bank said in a report published on Tuesday, outlining how the economic costs of climate change are only adding to the environmental and human toll. </p><br><p>But while investors face increasing uncertainty from climate risks in assessing asset values, there are strong, long-term investing opportunities in sustainable innovations, the bank said on Tuesday. </p><br><p>Leveraging resources like oil and lumber has helped spur incredible economic growth in the modern era, including halving the number of people living in extreme poverty over the last 30 years, UBS said in the report, released ahead of Earth Day on April 22.</p><br><p>But it has come at the cost of depleting those resources. Amid a wider social shift toward sustainability, investors are increasingly looking to evaluate investments under a framework of environmental, social, and governance factors, called ESG.</p><br><p>“Companies that are on the right side of history, when it comes to climate change and reducing their own carbon footprint, will better be positioned to prevent climate risks, deal with tighter regulations, and avoid reputational concerns,” said Solita Marcelli, UBS Global Wealth Management’s chief investment officer for the Americas, in a call with the media.</p><br><p>“Companies that emerge as leaders in developing solutions to tackle environmental challenges could really offer attractive long term growth prospects,” Marcelli added. “We think sustainability will continue to grow as a core part of the decisions that investors make as they build out their portfolios.”</p><br><p>“Companies that emerge as leaders in developing solutions to tackle environmental challenges could really offer attractive long term growth prospects,” Marcelli added. “We think sustainability will continue to grow as a core part of the decisions that investors make as they build out their portfolios.”</p><br><p><h4>People, health and communities</h4>Air pollution is the greatest environmental-linked threat to humans, UBS said, and is the fourth leading cause of death around the world. Climate change has profound human implications, the bank said, including extreme heat in urban centers that is increasingly claiming lives.</p><br><p>The bank suggests investing in treatments for illnesses linked to climate change, which includes both drugs and medical devices. Urban planning solutions will also be critical, UBS said, including technologies for “smart cities” — data-driven communities that use technology to operate more efficiently. </p><br><p><h4>Energy</h4>Emissions related to energy account for more than two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the bank. But a major problem facing the energy angle of addressing climate change is ensuring that humanity’s vast energy needs are met, UBS said. As we move toward new technologies and infrastructure, long-term sustainability needs to be considered, the bank said, and the role of government will be key.</p><br><p>Investors should look to companies with energy-efficiency solutions, as well as those focused on generating renewable energy like wind and solar, according to UBS. Alternative fuels in the form of hydrogen, biofuels, natural gas, and synthetic fuels are also likely to become more popular, the bank said.</p><br><p>UBS also highlighted the emerging role of electric transport and the role that fuel cell and battery companies will play in facilitating the rise of cleaner vehicles. UBS is bullish on electric vehicles, and predicts that EVs will penetrate 100% of the automobile market by 2040, with Volkswagen joining Tesla as the most dominant players in an industry that includes rivals NIO XPeng and General Motors  </p><br><p><h4>Land</h4>Land use follows energy as the second-largest source of global emissions, which come from land-clearing activity like the lumber industry as well as intensive farming, UBS said. But these emissions aren’t the only extent of the environmental cost of using land resources. There are major environmental costs from habitat and ecosystem destruction that have knock-on effects on the water, food, and air humans need to survive. Land management systems will be key in future sustainability, according to UBS.</p><br><p>One of the key areas the bank said to invest in is land-use monitoring and supply-chain validation systems. This includes projects using blockchain — the cryptographic network that underpins bitcoin ethereum and even dogecoin — as well as drones.</p><br><p>Smart agriculture, such as biotech, genetic engineering ventures, and vertical farming are another avenue for investment, the bank said. Sustainable production and consumption trends, largely through lab-grown as well as plant-based meat — like that made by Beyond Meat — are also becoming more popular, UBS said.</p><br><p><h4>Water</h4>Supplies of fresh water — one of the world’s scarcest resources — will face increasing pressure from rising populations, ongoing urbanization, and industrialization in emerging markets, UBS said. That will come on top of agriculture, which already consumes around 70% of accessible fresh water, according to the report.</p><br><p>Water tech will be critical to solving problems from water supply, UBS said, with investment opportunities including smart water networks, water automation systems, water meters, water testing equipment, and desalination equipment.</p><br><p>UBS said that the size of the global water market was estimated at $655 billion in 2020 — and that is expected to grow at mid-single-digit rates annually over the next few years.' },

    story: 'The billionaire founder of the Chinese electric vehicle (EV) company that is now one of the most valuable car makers in the world has called on the leaders of the US and China to develop "better trust in each other" as they try to reach a new deal on reducing carbon emissions.</p><br><p>William Li is the founder of Chief Executive of NIO. The EV maker is sometimes labelled as China`s Tesla killer. Its value has skyrocketed since the firm came close to financial collapse in late 2019.</p><br><p>Speaking to the BBC in Shanghai, just a few days after the US Presidential envoy on climate John Kerry came to the city for two days of talks with government officials, Mr Li said that "under current international relations it is very hard to achieve a mutual understanding."</p><br><p>NIO is at the forefront of China`s home-made effort to dominate the EV industry. It has bet big on interchangeable batteries in its cars as a way to overcome customer concerns about frequent charging.</p><br><p>China`s EV market currently faces overcapacity and a plethora of players. The number of registered manufacturers is over 500. In March EV sales in China broke through the symbolic 10% of total vehicle sales.</p><br><p>Tesla is also now making cars in China for the Chinese market. Elon Musk secured significant financial support for his factory from the Shanghai government.</p><br><p>Li Bin, as he is known in China, told the BBC that he thinks Tesla has been the biggest beneficiary of state efforts to spur development, saying the US giant "is the one who benefits most from Chinese regulations".</p><br><p>Mr Li added that policy support from Beijing "does not specifically apply to one company or one industry ... this is not just about one company but the whole (of) society have to work on it."</p><br><p>NIO and Tesla are now among the most valuable car companies in the world; worth more than Ford, despite having sales that are still in the thousands, not the millions. Both are at the forefront of the race to develop the most advanced proprietary knowledge on Autonomous Driving.</p><br><p>William Li is a serial entrepreneur and since NIO`s founding in 2014 he has emerged as one of China`s best known tech leaders. NIO is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Mr Li has drawn comparisons to the founder of e-commerce platform Alibaba Jack Ma, who also has a sizable footprint in both China and the US.</p><br><p>But Mr Ma`s business empire has been under increasing pressure from China`s financial and anti-monopoly regulators, and many are worried that other Chinese tech firms might be next.</p><br><p>Asked if he was nervous about such prominence and being labelled a Jack Ma of the EV industry, Mr Li told the BBC "we are a customer based company and I never worried about such things".</p><br><p>These are nervous times though for firms that face regulatory demands in the US and China, and have global ambitions that span both countries.</p><br><p>NIO was worried about talking to the BBC. Particularly after a recent campaign in China`s state run media, attacking the corporation for its coverage of human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Covid-19.</p><br><p>One senior media executive at the firm told us they did not want to be the only EV company featured in any BBC coverage of China`s efforts to deal with pollution.</p><br><p>Months of negotiations about trying to secure an interview with the CEO William Li only proved successful when I was able to meet him in person.</p><br><p>NIO is leading the charge for China in an industry that it hopes to revolutionise. It has the backing of global investors, but also an arm of the Chinese government, which helped keep it afloat in 2019.</p><br><p>One other media executive at the firm told me that drawing international attention to their efforts is "a balancing act".</p>' },

Radke writes in a research note that a survey of resellers and channel checks make him more confident that Microsoft can drive revenue across all three primary business segments, with strength in PC demand from both consumers and businesses, robust upgrade activity on server software and continued strength in Azure “driven by continued strong enterprise consumption growth.”</p><br><p>And he sees the strength in server and Azure to be sustainable beyond the third quarter, providing “a good set up” for both the fiscal fourth quarter and into the June 2022 fiscal year.</p><br><p>Concludes Radkle: “We continue to see Microsoft as the best-positioned mega-cap in software as we see double-digit growth (revenue and profits) at scale as sustainable.”</p><br><p>Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne likewise is bullish on the quarter; he repeats his Outperform rating and $300 target. Materne expects “another strong report” driven in particular by strength in Azure and Office 365.</p><br><p>Materne thinks the quarter will offer “another validation of why Microsoft remains a core holding for software investors,” with durable revenue and profit growth and a fortress balance sheet. He adds that when you consider the strong macroeconomic backdrop, there is potential for June quarter results to top estimates.</p><br><p>Cowen analyst J. Derrick Wood, who has an Outperform rating and $280 target price on Microsoft shares, writes in a research note that there is a possibility that Azure decelerated modestly in the March quarter, but he nonetheless expects the company to post upside to consensus estimates, and sees re-acceleration in the June quarter on easier year-over-year comparisons.</p><br><p>“We think shares strike a good balance of growth and value and remain constructive on the company’s momentum in gaining cloud market share,” Wood writes. “Microsoft’s hybrid cloud approach is well-positioned to benefit not only from continued Covid-19 related tailwinds, but also from employees returning to office and digital-transformation budgets returning to pre-pandemic levels.”</p><br><p>On Wednesday, Microsoft stock is up 0.8% to $260.27.' },

    story: 'GameStop rallied Monday after the video game retailer announced its CEO succession plan as it tries to pivot to e-commerce following a historic short squeeze.</p><br><p>Shares of GameStop jumped more than 6% to close at $164.37.</p><br><p>The company said CEO George Sherman will step down by July 31. It said the board is leading a search to identify CEO candidates who can accelerate the next phase of the company’s transformation.</p><br><p>While GameStop shares are well below the record highs of $483 reached in January, the stock is still up a whopping 770% for 2021. To take advantage of the massive Reddit-fueled rally, GameStop announced a $1 billion stock sale earlier this month. It plans to use the sale’s proceeds to aid its transition into e-commerce, which is led by activist investor and Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen.</p><br><p>The company also hired former Amazon and Google executive Jenna Owens as its new chief operating officer.</p><br><p>“GameStop’s next CEO and CFO are likely to come from the tech industry, as with the other recent senior hires, and would require a wide range of strategic and operational experience, given GameStop’s complex business model, including ~4,800 global stores, digital, used games, new software and hardware, and collectibles,” Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joseph Feldman wrote in a note.</p><br><p>Some investors also took comfort in Keith Gill doubling down on his GameStop bet. On Friday, he decided to forgo millions of dollars in quick profit from an options trade. Gill is perhaps the biggest influencer in the Reddit retail trading crowd.</p><br><p>The investor — who goes by DeepF------Value on Reddit and Roaring Kitty on YouTube — exercised his 500 GameStop call options contracts as they expired on Friday, giving him 50,000 more shares at a strike price of just $12. Gill could could have made more than $7 million on the bet if he had sold the options at Friday’s price.</p><br><p>Gill also bought 50,000 more GameStop shares, bringing his total investment to 200,000 shares worth more than $30 million.</p><br><p>Gill’s trading information is based on his Reddit posts, which appear to be snapshots of his investment account. The posts were not independently verified by CNBC.</p><br><p>Still, Wall Street analysts’ consensus is that GameStop’s stock price is significantly detached from fundamentals. Tesley maintained its underperform rating and 12-month price target of just $30 per share.</p><br><p>“We continue to believe the current valuation far exceeds our rosy fundamental expectations and projected multi-year benefits from the strategic transformation,” Feldman said.' }
